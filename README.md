# Clusters Inspector
* node
* react 
* node:cluster
* koa

###### v 1.0.0

This is a POC based on my node-react minimalist framework. This is another environment to test clusters in node.

You can test the api layer with an Api client:

```
localhost:3000/shortCall
```

```
localhost:3000/longCall
```

```
localhost:3000/heavyCallAsync
```

```
localhost:3000/heavyCallWT
```
